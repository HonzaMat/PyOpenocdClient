PyOpenocdClient documentation
=============================

**PyOpenocdClient** is a Python library for controlling `OpenOCD`_ software tool.
It allows to send commands from Python programs to OpenOCD (commands like halt execution
of the debugged target, read data from memory, read values of processor registers, ...)
and receive results of these commands.

OpenOCD is controlled by commands written in TCL language, and the set of available
commands can be found in `OpenOCD documentation`_.
